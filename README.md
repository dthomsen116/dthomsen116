# üí´ About Me:
My name is David Thomsen and I am a rising senior at Champlain College. My most recent project has been reworking my github to be more put together, so aplogies if there are some slight bumps while I am working on it. 
<br>

## Personal projects I am looking forward to include:
- A server specifically to be used for Virtual Machines for Class/Personal use
- A Discord Bot that can be multi-use for different servers ([MilkBot](https://github.com/dthomsen116/MilkBot)).
- More AI research as it is something that greatly interests me. (Check out the attempt I made at making a Chatbot a while back [here](https://github.com/dthomsen116/ChatBotAttempt))
- A [Virtual Assistant](https://github.com/dthomsen116/Virt-Assistant) to be used for local common tasks and exploring the possibilities of this new assistant ü§ñ. 
- Who knows what else...?

## CollaborationüëØ: 
I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on anything that would build on previous knowledge and expands into new territory. 

## Helpü§ù:
